# AutoPlayer
Watch your favorite series without any stopping.

# About this Player
You are watching a series from your laptop. And you tiered of the need to switch eposide every second.
You closed the eposide by mistake and forgot where you stopped.
Well this software is exactlly for this 2 situations.

It's saves the last position you exited the video if you choose to. And changes eposides automatically if it detect you are watching an eposide from a series.

# How to use this Player
Well first you launch the software not the video.
Then you choose the video you would like to see. If you exit the player while the clip is running.
The player will pop a message box. That asks you if you want to save the position of the clip.
Next time you run the player. It will ask if you want to continue watching the video you were seen.

If you choose a video that's name includes for example "S01E01". The player will try to find the next eposide.
In the folder of the clip you chose.
And will play it automatically as soon as the eposide finishes.

# Why I made this Player
I watch 2 series almost all the time which is The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother.
I do that with my laptop connected to the tv. The simple solution would be remote mouse so I bought one.
For changing eposides but it's sill annoying. And sometimes I would closed the eposide and forgot
where did I stop.
So to solve this problems I made this software.

# Future plans
* For now the player stores only 1 last played time. Next it will have a database which will store any clip
that will be played.
* The player using the database it stores will save last watched eposide per series.
* The player will automatically switch to next season eposide.
