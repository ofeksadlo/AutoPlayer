# AutoPlayer
Watch your favorite series without any stopping.

# About this Player
You are watching a series from your laptop. And you tiered of the need to switch eposide every second.
You closed the eposide by mistake and forgot where you stopped.
Well this software is exactlly for this 2 situations.

It's saves the last position of the video you watched for every clip you played. And changes eposides automatically if it detect you are watching an eposide from a series.

# How to use this Player
Well first you launch the software not the video.
For the first time you launch the software.
You choose the video you would like to see. Next time you open the player it will remember
the last clip you were watching.
If you exit the player while the clip is running.
The player will save the last position you were on that specific clip.
And next time you open the software it will launch the clip you closed with the
position you stopped.

If you choose a video that's name includes for example "S01E01". The player will try to find the next eposide.
In the folder of the clip you chose.
And will play it automatically as soon as the eposide finishes.

You can also right click the player and click Next/Previous eposide or open media.

# Why I made this Player
I watch 2 series almost all the time which is The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother.
I do that with my laptop connected to the tv. The simple solution would be remote mouse so I bought one.
For changing eposides but it's sill annoying. And sometimes I would closed the eposide and forgot
where did I stop.
So to solve this problems I made this software.

# Future plans
* The player will automatically switch to next season eposide.
* The player will have a settings window there you can change the UI mode.
And set keywords for next eposide searching (The default is S01E01 using the setting you will be able to add more).
